abstract  ="A fundamental understanding of the inter-relationships between structure{,} morphology{,} atomic scale dynamics{,} chemistry{,} and physical properties of mixed metallic-covalent systems is essential to design novel functional materials for applications in flexible nano-electronics{,} energy storage and catalysis. To achieve such knowledge{,} it is imperative to develop robust and computationally efficient atomistic models that describe atomic interactions accurately within a single framework. Here{,} we present a unified Tersoff-Brenner type bond order potential (BOP) for a Co-C system{,} trained against lattice parameters{,} cohesive energies{,} equation of state{,} and elastic constants of different crystalline phases of cobalt as well as orthorhombic Co2C derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The independent BOP parameters are determined using a combination of supervised machine learning (genetic algorithms) and local minimization via the simplex method. Our newly developed BOP accurately describes the structural{,} thermodynamic{,} mechanical{,} and surface properties of both the elemental components as well as the carbide phases{,} in excellent accordance with DFT calculations and experiments. Using our machine-learnt BOP potential{,} we performed large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effect of metal/carbon concentration on the structure and mechanical properties of porous architectures obtained via self-assembly of cobalt nanoparticles and fullerene molecules. Such porous structures have implications in flexible electronics{,} where materials with high electrical conductivity and low elastic stiffness are desired. Using unsupervised machine learning (clustering){,} we identify the pore structure{,} pore-distribution{,} and metallic conduction pathways in self-assembled structures at different C/Co ratios. We find that as the C/Co ratio increases{,} the connectivity between the Co nanoparticles becomes limited{,} likely resulting in low electrical conductivity; on the other hand{,} such C-rich hybrid structures are highly flexible (i.e.{,} low stiffness). The BOP model developed in this work is a valuable tool to investigate atomic scale processes{,} structure-property relationships{,} and temperature/pressure response of Co-C systems{,} as well as design organic-inorganic hybrid structures with a desired set of properties."}
